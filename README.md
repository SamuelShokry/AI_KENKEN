  - PLUS_MINUS
  - TIMES_DIVIDED
  - ALL_OPERATIONS
- Supports all sizes from 3 up to 9, inclusive.
- Generate random games given the required size and operations mode
- Can solve the generated game using 3 different algorithms:

  - Backtracking with Forward Checking
  - Backtracking with Forward Checking and Arc Consistency
- Can save a solved or unsolved game on the disk in a path of the user's choice
- CTRL + S : shortcut for saving a game
- Can load a saved game from the disk, display and solve it
- CTRL + O : shortcut for loading a stored game
- Clear the solution and/or the entire game
- Has a compare mode:
  - user can choose: 
    - GAME_COUNT
    - GAME_SIZE
    - GAME_MODE 
    - required algorithms to be compared
  - the program will generate and solve the required games and display the total time taken to solve them using each algorithm
  - Games are displayed while being solved
  - Progress bar is used to display the overall progress
  - Solving the games and comparing the algorithms can be:
    - Paused
    - Resumed
    - Cancelled
- The program has a status bar to reflect the current status
- Buttons are enabled and disabled according to the currently allowed operations, to minimize user's errors
- input is checked against user's errors
